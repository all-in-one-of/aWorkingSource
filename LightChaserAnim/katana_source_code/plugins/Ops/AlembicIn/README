AlembicIn Op
============

Notes on custom OpenEXR namespaces:

- By default the Makefile assumes a Foundry-namespaced version of OpenEXR.
- You will need to modify the Makefile if you use a standard or custom
  namespaced version of OpenEXR in your facility.
- Look for the section "OpenEXR Custom Namespace" in the Makefile. In the
  case where you have a standard OpenEXR library simply comment the entire
  section out, otherwise modify them to your custom namespace.
