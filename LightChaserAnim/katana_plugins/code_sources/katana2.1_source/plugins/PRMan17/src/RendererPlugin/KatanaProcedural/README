PRMan 17 KatanaProcedural
=========================

Environment Variables
---------------------

BOOST_HOME    The root of the boost directory.
KATANA_HOME   The Katana installation directory at compile-time
OPENEXR_HOME  The installation directory of openEXR
RMANTREE      The installation directory of renderman

Building
--------

1. Ensure the environment variables listed above have been set.
2. Run 'make'.
3. Copy 'out/KatanaProcedural.so' to the 'Libs' subdirectory within a
   Katana resources path.

Testing
-------

To build and run a simple test application that tests KatanaProcedural.cpp
without loading it as DSO or launching PRMan.

1. 'cd' into 'testapp'.
2. Run 'make test'.
3. The test program should spew RIB to stdout.

Currently boost is needed for the shared_ptr type. You could potentially change
the source code in KatanaProcedural to use tr1 if you'd rather not use boost.
